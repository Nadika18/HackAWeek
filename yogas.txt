Savasana
Savasana, also known as corpse pose, is a yoga posture that is typically done at the end of a yoga practice. It involves lying on the back with the body relaxed and the eyes closed. The goal of this pose is to release tension from the body and allow the mind to become still. It is believed to promote relaxation, reduce stress, and improve overall well-being. Savasana is typically held for several minutes at the end of a yoga practice.
